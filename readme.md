# Topic: Take Command of Azure PowerShell

## Abstract
Cloud providers like Azure continually deliver new features and capabilities each day, like pieces to an ever expanding puzzle. I've found an edge to the puzzle in Azure PowerShell, and I'll share that edge with you in this beginner level session.

Using PowerShell 7, we'll begin from first login, discovering command syntax, common command features and shortcuts, and how command line increases your understanding and ability to build confidently in the cloud.

### The Core of the Matter

* Microsoft made open source .Net Core to enable .Net Devs & Admins to be productive in Linux & macOS
* PowerShell Core is built on .Net Core, and serves I.T. Admins, DevOps folks, AND Devs the same way.
